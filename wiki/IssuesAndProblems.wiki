=== Cross platform desktop operations ===
This tasks need cross platform library:
{{{

On Linux/Unix: pyxdg/GIO/gnome-vfs can be used. For other platforms other solution is needed.

-----
{{{
- Get a list of prefered applications for a file
}}}
On Linux/Unix WM gnome-vfs-python or GIO or pykde4 can be used. Other systems, something more flexible for Linux/Unix?
----
{{{
- Trashcan/Trash specification
}}}
Use native OS tras specifications... what are they?


=== Terminal access ===
{{{
1. Use qtermwidget
2. Use solution from Eric IDE
}}}
qtermwidget is based on Konsole, KDE4 apps run on OS X and Windows. Will Qtermwidget run correctly on Windows?
