=== Cross platform desktop operations ===
This tasks need cross platform library:
{{{
- Determine file  MIME, with magic numbers test if possible
- Get system icons for files, folders etc.
}}}
On Linux/Unix: pyxdg can be used. For other platforms other solution is needed.


{{{
- Get a list of prefered applications for a file
}}}
On Linux/Unix WM gnome-vfs-python or GIO or pykde4 can be used. Other systems, something more flexible for Linux/Unix?


=== Terminal access ===
{{{
1. Use qtermwidget
2. Use solution from Eric IDE
}}}
qtermwidget is based on Konsole, KDE4 apps run on OS X and Windows. Will Qtermwidget run correctly on Windows?
